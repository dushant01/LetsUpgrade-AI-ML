    "PyOD is a comprehensive and scaleable python toolkit for detecting outlying objects in multivariate data .\n",
    "It was developed back in 2017 and has been used in many academic research and commercial products .\n",
    "PyOD Uses:\n",
    "It is featured for Unified APIs ,detailed documentation and interactive examples across Various Algorithms.\n",
    "In Advanced models,includinf Neural Networks and outlier Ensembles\n",
    "Optimized performance with JIT and parallelization when possible,using namba and joblib.\n",
    "Benchmark of Various outlier detection models:\n",
    "Linear Models for Outlier Detection :Wehn one increases or decreases with respect to other it is linear.\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis :Based on the contribution can we remove any of the feature and choose the most important ones is PCA.\n",
    "Minimum Covariance Determinant :Covariance is the difference bet std deviation and other variance values .So using a limit from the midpoint we can detect outliers after a range.\n",
    "One-Class Support Vector Machine:WE can take all the inliner and remove the uncertain and out of the line problems.\n",
